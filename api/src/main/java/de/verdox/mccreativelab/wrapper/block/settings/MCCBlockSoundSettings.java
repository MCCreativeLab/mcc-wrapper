/**
 * Used to customize the sounds blocks make when breaking, digging, stepping on them.
 * This logic is not supported by the minecraft native platform so here is a quick guide on how to achieve that.
 * <p>
 * Since the client defines block sound groups like wood minecraft only allows us to change the sounds of these groups.
 * Hence, we first need to replace those sound groups in the resource packs with empty sounds. As a result the player won't hear anything when breaking
 * the specific block at first. That is where we simulate the sound on the server side. When walking over blocks all players but the player doing the action
 * will hear the sound because the native minecraft platform sends the corresponding packets. We then make sure that the
 * player causing the sounds also receives those packets. Since we control the server software we can interfere with this process and change the sound that is
 * sent to all players. The result is that all players hear the new sound.
